                        population toward the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive survey was designed and disseminated via
                        social media platforms. The survey consisted of 32 questions addressing respondent's
                        demographics, knowledge, practice, and attitude toward the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 25,994
                        Egyptians participated in the survey from the 29 Egyptian governorates. More than 99% of the
                        respondents were aware of the COVID-19 pandemic. Responses showed split opinions regarding
                        whether people should wear gloves or masks to prevent COVID-19 infection (47.7% and 49.5%
                        replied with "False", respectively). Almost one-quarter (23.1%) of the respondents went to
                        crowded places during the last 14 days. Calling the emergency hotline and self-isolation at home
                        were the most frequent practices to deal with COVID-19 symptoms (34.1% and 44.5%, respectively).
                        A total of 85% of respondents reported their confidence in the Egyptian healthcare system to win
                        the battle against COVID-19 despite the challenges. A vast majority of this large population
                        sample reported reasonable knowledge levels and potentially appropriate practices toward
                        COVID-19.<br><a style="color:red;">To read the full article</a> <a

                    <p class="article-body"> Pandemics are large-scale outbreaks of infectious disease that can
                        greatly increase morbidity and mortality over a wide geographic area and cause significant
                        economic, social, and political disruption. Evidence suggests that the likelihood of pandemics
                        has increased over the past century because of increased global travel and integration,
                        urbanization, changes in land use, and greater exploitation of the natural environment (Jones
                        and others 2008; Morse 1995). These trends likely will continue and will intensify. Significant
                        policy attention has focused on the need to identify and limit emerging outbreaks that might
                        lead to pandemics and to expand and sustain investment to build preparedness and health capacity
                        (Smolinsky, Hamburg, and Lederberg 2003).

                        The international community has made progress toward preparing for and mitigating the impacts of
                        pandemics. The 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic and growing concerns about
                        the threat posed by avian influenza led many countries to devise pandemic plans (U.S. Department
                        of Health and Human Services 2005). Delayed reporting of early SARS cases also led the World
                        Health Assembly to update the International Health Regulations (IHR) to compel all World Health
                        Organization member states to meet specific standards for detecting, reporting on, and
                        responding to outbreaks (WHO 2005). <br><a style="color:red;">To read the full article

                    <p class="article-body">The COVID-19 pandemic has turned the health care system upside down and
                        challenged consumers’ sense of well-being. In many ways, consumers are taking charge of their
                        health more than ever before. They are learning about their health risks, communicating with
                        their doctors in new and different ways, and changing their attitudes about data privacy. Each
                        of these factors has a significant influence on how patients are interacting with the health
                        system. Going forward, how will these events and factors change their behavior? Are we more or
                        less likely to see empowered health care consumers? The Deloitte “2020 Survey of U.S. Health
                        Care Consumers” provides insights into current U.S. consumer behaviors and attitudes. Since
                        2008, Deloitte has been conducting this biennial survey to explore and collect longitudinal data
                        on the subject. This year’s survey was fielded just before the pandemic started; additional
                        research, the “Health Care Consumer Response to COVID-19 Survey,” collected insights in April
                        and early May.

                        Findings show that:

                        <b>Many consumers are demonstrating agency and engagement</b>. Patients increasingly are willing
                        to tell their doctors when they disagree with them and are using tools to get information on
                        health issues and costs. Consumers also are tracking their health conditions, using that data to
                        make decisions, and accessing and using their medical record data.<br><a style="color:red;">To
